# Outcome/Income Tracker

This is a my first program,
it's a basic program which tracks your outcomes and incomes.

I've created this in Eclipse using JavaFX.

versions
1.0
1.01	added ReadMe file
1.02	added methods descriptions
1.03	pre-sorting by date
1.04	added filtering entries (last 30 days) by ToggleButton there is a BUG entries cannot be sorted after filtering (it's not supported yet by FilteredList)
		redesigned ToolBaradded Buttons for adding, editing and deleting
		added arrow to the sorting column at the start of application
		redesigned MenuBar
		
	

Still to implement:
- statistics
- cell colors
- filtering (implemented by not working as intended)
- proper ToolBar (implemented)
- singleton
- exception handling
- data binding
